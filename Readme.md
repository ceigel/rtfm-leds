# RTFM Leds

This is a toy application using [Real Time For the Masses](https://github.com/rtfm-rs/cortex-m-rtfm) framework for the STM32F3DISCOVERY board.

The example shows 4 behaviors:
- The current led blinks
- User-button click: next-led blinks
- User-button double-click: change direction of "next-led" to mean previous led
- User-button hold: Flash the leds 3 times
